          The neural network model was tested automatically in the training
          environment prior to integration with the web service. Of the 45,000
          articles in the data set, 25% of those articles were partitioned into
          a separate testing set. Keras was used to batch test this set after
          training, and the model achieved a 98% accuracy score.

        <h2 className="h3">Post-Integration Testing</h2>
        <p className="testing-page-content">
          After integrating the neural network model into the web service, many
          articles found on the internet were manually fed into it to better
          compare its accuracy against newer data independent of the initial
          training and testing sets. The model tends to do well with articles
          centered around politics and world events, but it isn't as performant
          with other topics. This suggests the training set was biased towards
          the aforementioned subjects.
